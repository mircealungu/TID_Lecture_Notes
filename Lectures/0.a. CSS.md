# CSS 

Originally CSS for styling; HTML for content. Thought out to really separate programming from styling. In practice, it's very hard to separate the two. 


### Seems simple. Why bother?

I've always Googled stuff. And these days you can ask ChatGPT. And that's fine. However, both when Googling, and especially when ChatGPT-ing, you must understand, in order to select the best solution. If you just 

Quite a complicated concept if you look at the [number of questions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags) (compared with Java half the questions... also daily)

[Most asked question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1014861/is-there-a-css-parent-selector) - what do we learn from the discussion? 
- pseudo-classes 
- ever evolving (look at the [date](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#relational) of the referred Draft)
- different browsers have different implementations (e.g. implementation of [:has](https://caniuse.com/css-has))
- functional pseudo-selector

You **must** know: 
- [Type, class, and id](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors#type_class_and_id_selectors)
- [Attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors#attribute_selectors)
- [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) certain states (e.g. a:hover, input:checked, [p:first-child:first-letter](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/drop-caps/))
- [Combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Combinators), e.g. `article>p`

	- How to style specially an item that has the property `is-selected`, e.g. `<li is-selected>Home</li>`?
	- Which is correct: `element [property]` and `element[property]`?

# Cascade, Inheritance, and Specificity 

To Read at Home: [article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance)

The **cascade** is an algorithm that defines how user agents combine property values originating from different sources: browser stylesheet, [user-defined stylesheet](https://www.thoughtco.com/user-style-sheet-3469931) (an old concept that does not make sense these days), and website author stylesheet. Author stylesheet has precedence. 

[What is specificity in CSS and what is more specific: a class selector or an element selector?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#specificity)
- see example

[What is inheritance?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#inheritance)
- see example

To answer: 
- What has higher priority: the style for an element or for a class? But a class or an id? 


# **The Box Model**

Everything in CSS has a box around it.

A block box in CSS has: content area, padding, [margin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#margin), border: 

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230830163232.png)

Two box models:
1. [Standard Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#the_standard_css_box_model): padding & border is added to the width & height
2. [Border-Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#the_alternative_css_box_model): content area width = width - padding & border

To think about: which do you prefer?

## Flow Layouts

Depending on the type, there are several types of outer display types. In what's called the  [Normal flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flow_layout/Block_and_inline_layout_in_normal_flow) elements with the corresponding 
- display: inline -- layout horizontally (e.g. words in a paragraph).
- display: block -- layout vertically (e.g. paragraphs)
- display: [inline-block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#using_display_inline-block) -- layout block inside, and horizontally in the context

## In Flow and Out of Flow

See: [article]((https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flow_layout/In_flow_and_out_of_flow))

- Out of flow items create their own mini-layout (a new **formatting context**)
- Out of flow items:
	- [floated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats#display_flow-root) items - originally for floating images inside text; later used for all kinds of layout hacks; now returned back to original 
	- elements  with `position: absolute`  
	- elements with `position: fixed` 


## Exercise

Can you implement a CSS layout for a website that provides translations? It should add the translation above the original text as in the figure below. 

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230830174522.png)
Start from the following HTML, and define the 

```
<html>
	<p>
	Zoom demande à ses salariés de <span class="trans"><span class="eng">to return face-to-face</span><span class="fr">revenir en présentiel</span></trans>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	En 2020, les revenus de l’entreprise <span class="trans"><span class="eng">had more than tripled<span class="eng"><span class="fr">avaient plus que triplé</span></trans> ; ils ont même continué d’augmenter en 2021, d’environ 55 %. Mais la progression a fortement ralenti l’année dernière : dans la période post-pandémie, la société de vidéo conférence a vu ses bénéfices chuter.
