What makes an application design useful?
It's solving an actual important need of the user.
The first step to success is understanding the user and their needs.

## How do designers capture user needs?
- Functional Requirements, user stories, the MoSCoW method, etc.

	- Goal directed
	- Role-based
	- Engaging Personas 



## üßë‚Äçüé® Project Work
