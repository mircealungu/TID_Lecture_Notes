## What is JSX?

JSX is a JavaScript render function that helps you insert your HTML right into your JavaScript code. 

Similar languages exist for many other front-end frameworks ([nice comparison between JSX and Vue templates](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reacts-jsx-vs-vue-s-templates-a-showdown-on-the-front-end-b00a70470409/)) and also server-side rendering frameworks (e.g. Jinja for Flask).
