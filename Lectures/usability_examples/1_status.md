# Visibility of system status

The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

## Examples

### Mircea 
Miele Dishwasher in the DR building. 

It is not clear when it is running or not, even if there is a digital display! In fact, when first time users are looking at the display it shows a time, and a temperature, it makes it seem like the dishwasher is actually running. But it is not - it simply shows the details of the currently selected programme.

This is why somebody had to stick an external status gear, that now users have to manually update.  This is design against humanity.
