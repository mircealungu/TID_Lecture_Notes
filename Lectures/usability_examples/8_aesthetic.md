# Aesthetic and minimalist design

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

## Examples

### Johan

The website www.arngren.net cotains so much information on the index page, that it is hard for your eyes to find a pattern in the chaos. The content is the opposite of minimalistic and the initial shock is too much for most user. I guess that the average user will last about 2 seconds before leaving the website in horror.
