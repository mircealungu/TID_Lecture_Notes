Importance of Aesthetics
### Color
- You need more colors than you think
- Define your shades upfront
		1. greys (you'll need more grays than you think)
		2. primary colors (what makes facebook feel blue)
		3. accent colors (highlight a new feature, warning message, dangerous action, positive trend)
- You need more grays than you think
- Use HSL instead of HEX
- Ensure sufficient contrast
- Never convey info only through color


### Typography
- Optimize for legibility
- Predefine a good scale for your text
- Keep line length in check
- Align multiple text styles on baseline not center
- Line height can help with readability
- Line height and font size are related
- Don’t center long text
- Right align numbers
- Hyphen narrow justified text
- Narrow justified text can be awkward


## Class Activity

## Design systems

To make sure that a whole team is on the same page, one collects all the rules 
regarding the above mentioned aspects of layoutn, color, typography, spacing, but also other project-wide conventions (like icons, layouts, components) 
in a living document called a design system. 

Some design systems are very general: e.g. Fluent from Microsoft, Material from Google, - [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) - even if specific for OS X incredibly well written; the web designer can still learn from it

Some are more specific. - [Mailchimp Pattern Library](http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns/helpers) - a good example of how a design system for a product can look.
