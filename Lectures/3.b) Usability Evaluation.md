- You can evaluate with any prototype - the more detailed, the more realistic, the more you can trust your results
- You should be able to rank and prioritize the problems you discover


Sometimes you don't start from scratch: evaluating an existing prototype for usability is even easier - you don't have to create the prototype. 

In any case you need to prepare a set of tasks and ask the users to perform them, then observe. 

The tasks should be expressed from the POV of the user, not from the POV of the system. They should express a need of the user, and not be helping by suggesting which UI elements to be used. That will skew the results.
