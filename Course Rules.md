# Communication
- If a question is of general interest, write to the LearnIt forum
- For personal stuff reach Mircea, Cecil, or Iga
# Group Formation

- In the first course hour we hold a democratic vote whether to randomly form groups or to self-organize
	- Random groups - will be generated using Javascript in class
	- Self-organized groups
		- Have till next Wednesday@noon to figure out whom they want to work with

# Deliverables
