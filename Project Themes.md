## Project 0: A Messaging Client
- You have to implement a variation of WhatsApp for a special audience?
- E.g. the elderly would want a very simple application, etc.

## Project 1: A Decentralized Social Media Website with Nostr

nostr is a communication protocol that is very simple, and aims to encourage communication that is censorship-resistant. 
- [Readme.md](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr)
- [Cutting through spam](https://www.reddit.com/r/nostr/comments/121ytwf/cutting_through_the_spam_on_damus/)

At its core, it allows cryptographically signed messages to be forwarded to other users. The most natural application to build on top of such a protocol would be an alternative to Twitter.

You have to implement a `nostr` client for communication with your fellow students. 
Examples of nostr clients are: Damus, etc.

## Project 2: A Centralized Social Media Website 

This is pretty much your chance to reimplement Twitter. But better. And again, for a specific audience. 

This version requires more backend work than the previous (nostr-based), because in this case you implement the server yourself with Parse.js. Not to worry,we will show you how to implement the server.
