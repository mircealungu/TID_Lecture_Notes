Will not teach
- git - and collaboration with git - this is assumed known (can we assume they've seen it in a previous course? e.g. Git Flow, and branches, and merges, and stuff?)
- javascript - basic javascript is expected
- clean code - do they know this stuff? 

To decide about deliverables
- does it make sense to have both lo-fi and hi-fi 

To decide about their project: 
- responsive design
- web-first? 


1. **[[1.a) Interaction Design]]**
	- Introduce the process
	- Present all the parts focusing on those not addressed in the upcoming lectures
	- Introduce project topic
	- Project: 
		- call for team preferences survey
	- Homework:
		- read for next time: User Understanding Methods
2. **Understanding Users and their Needs**
	- Meta:
		- announce teams
	- As a prerequisite for usefulness
	- Methods: discuss self-readings
	- Project: 
		- Define your users and their needs. 
		- (Ideally) Based on interviews with real users, create a persona
		- (Optionally) Empathy methods to better understand your persona
		- Adapt  the description of the project to your persona's needs #deliverable
			- where should the project be stored? 
3. **UI Design Patterns and Web Design Principles** (Lecture Video Available for 1:30min)
	- Read up on the Design Patterns
	- Watch the video
4. **Ideation and Prototyping**
	- Ideation ?
	- Prototyping
		- Rationale for prototyping
		- Types of prototypes
	- Intro to Figma (Guest lecture? Tutorial? Self learning?)
	- Project:
		- prototype a first draft of your UI on paper or in Figma - whatever it's fastest for you
		- write down an evaluation protocol (how are you going to test) #deliverable 
		- test the design with actual users
		- write up the results of the tests and propose changes to the design #deliverable 
		- apply the changes and create a final design #deliverable
		- iterate if necessary (for this you can use two weeks, next lecture there will little extra work added)
	- Homework (individual)
		- try out a create-react-app tutorial at home
	- Prerequisites
		- UI design patterns? 
		- Web design principles maybe? 
		- Mobile-first design?
		- Responsive design
5. **Intro to Component-Based Web Application Development with React** (Video Lecture 2h21!)
	- JSX
	- Components as Functions
	- Props
	- State
	- Integrating CSS
	- Project
		- Setup your project repo
		- Create a welcome page
		- Protect the master branch
		- To think about: Each team member picks up a component from the UI Design Patterns List and implements it in the /components folder
6. **Modeling and Backends** 
	- Domain Modeling
	- Intro to Parse (Low-code backends 1h)
	- Exercises:
		- discuss with us your components
		- work on your domain modeling together
	- Project:
		- create a [living document for your domain model] #deliverable 
		- add some test data in the database
7.  **Advanced Styling with React** 
	- CSS
		- Flexbox
		- Grid
	- The Styled Components Library 
	- Responsive design
	- Animations
	- Project: 
		- start using styled components
8. React Continued (Video of Comp comm, useEffect, building an app (1h44m))
	- Routing 
	- Component communication
	- Lifecycle methods
		- useEffect
	- Talking to a Backend (e.g. Parse)
	- The file organization of a React Project
	- Project:
		- Create login page
		- Create main app page
		- Start connecting to the backend (at least create the login part)




8. [[2.a) Usability]] (Where does this fit? ) - guest lecture? 
	- examples
	- principles
	- heuristics
	- evaluation methods


9. Advanced React
	- Context to Avoid Prop drilling
	- Understanding the Transpilation Process
	- Debugging
	- Advanced Hooks
	- Project:
		- keep at it


10. Advanced backend as a service
	 - functions
	 - advanced queries


11. Code Quality 
	- clean code principles
	- 

12. Deployment (1h lecture on Deployment available)


13. Final Presentations



15. Evaluation + Exam Preparation
